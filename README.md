This repo is my scratch repo for learning projects. I had a few of them, and I decided to put them all in this repo.
It's not very pretty on purpose, each folder "should" be its own repo, except I don't want to make one every time I learn something new.

This does mean that I lose the git history of learning-projects, learning-go, and jwt-typescript. 
This does pain me, but merging the git history into this repo was too much of a pain. 
Consider it lost, though as of time of writing I haven't deleted the repos.
