This folder is my following the [The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/) from ThePrimeagen on FrontendMasters

Also here is the idea but for golang taken from [here](https://github.com/nacknime-official/kata-machine-go)
because following the course in Typescript just off because it doesn't have pointers and its builtin Node craziness.

Primeagen went over this in the beginning of the course, because obviously you can take the ideas from Typescript and
apply them elsewhere but for me it makes more sense to do it at a "lower level".

It would be cool if I made this repo feature complete with the actual course's but I at least want to get through the course first.
